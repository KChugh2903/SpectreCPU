# Spectre-II
## Description
Spectre-II is a simple superscalar out-of-order RISC-V core able to execute up to 4 instructions per cycle and capable of booting Linux.

## Features
- RV32IMAC+ Instruction Set
- 4-wide superscalar OoO Execution (tag-indexed register file, load after issue)
- Implements RISC-V Privileged Spec (M/S/U mode, virtual memory, boots Linux)
- IFetch: 16 byte fetch, TAGE direction predictor, recovering return stack
- Memory: 2 loads per cycle, VIPT cache, late store data gathering, through-memory dependency tracking
- Default configuration scores 5.42 CoreMark/MHz and 4.0 to 11.8 DMIPS/MHz depending on compiler flags (see CI).

## Simulating
1. Install the [RV32 Linux Toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain) as well as Verilator (at least version 5.0).
2. Run `make setup` to build submodules.
3. Run `make` to build a binary with Verilator (alternatively, `make trace` will also generate VCD traces).
4. To run bare-metal code, use `./obj_dir/VTop <assembly file>` or `<baremetal elf file>`.
For example, run `./obj_dir/VTop test_programs/dhry_1.s` to run Dhrystone. Optionally add `--perfc` to print out perf counters, or `-x <start_time>` to specify when to enable tracing (`-x0` for tracing from start).
5. To run Linux, use `./obj_dir/VTop --perfc --device-tree=test_programs/linux/device_tree.dtb test_programs/linux/linux_image.elf` (or `make linux` for a full build). Log in as `root`, no password.
Building Linux and booting it in simulation takes at least a few hours!

### Console
The console input is line-buffered for easier input at low simulation speed. Within Linux,
you will thus see all input lines twice.

### Save/Restore (experimental)
While running, the simulator will save its state about once a minute if
`--backup-file=<NAME>.backup` is specified. Simulation can then be restarted
at the backup by running `./obj_dir/VTop <NAME>.backup`. The file name must
end with `.backup`. If cosim is enabled, a matching `.backup_cosim` file will
be written/read as well.

This is on by default for `make linux`. To restart a crashed or closed Linux boot
at the last checkpoint, use e.g. `./obj_dir/VTop spectreii.backup --backup-file=spectreii2.backup`.
(There seem to be some spurious segfaults in the Verilator-generated code.)
